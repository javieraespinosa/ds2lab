The Data Science and Data Systems (DAISY) Group is an open research and teaching collaboration by professors from the Department of Digital Sciences at CPE Lyon in the general area of data-centric systems.

The research interests of the group include the following areas:

- Cloud Computing & Datacenters
- Database, Data Processing and Machine Learning
- Data Management on Modern Hardware
- Data Science

Our research is characterized by:

- Collaborative research: our research projects are carried out in teams, with input and contributions from people with backgrounds and interests ranging from databases to operating systems and networks.
- Real systems: we typically work on complete systems that are mostly commercialized, licensed, or released as open source software.
- Ties to industry: our work is long-term, exploratory research, but many of our projects take place in collaboration with industry.
- Emphasis on tech transfer to education and industry: we place equal weight on research activities and university education. We aim to make these two goals indistinguishable by regularly bringing together experts from industry, students, and researchers to discuss ideas and projects, and by opening up our research projects to both students and industry.
